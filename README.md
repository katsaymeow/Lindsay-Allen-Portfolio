### I would like to note that I also chose to include my actually experience of maintaining a website. While we host our store with Shopify, a lot of work, and even some coding on my part, has gone into to it. I am personally responsible for the backend operations such as programing shipping rates based on location and making sure our pages link and function correctly. The last ten years of helping my husband reach his dreams sparked my interest in learning to code and lead me here.
Our site is https://www.mycohaus.com/

## What did I learn?

I want to really say, 'what am I still learning?'. Well, I feel as I underestimated the power of html element classes. I am submitting this under the wire, as I worked until the last minute to accomplish my style goals. I also feel as this work in completely unfinished and plan on resubmitting in the future.
Flexbox is fun once you get the hang of it. I let myself get so lost in trying to style it, that I was not giving the elements in html their classes to PROPERLY style it. Once I realized this ( with help from every direction offered to me ) I think I can accomplish this. I just did not come to this conclusion until today. I will admit I have spent at least 20 hours getting here, and that is completely too long.

I am including my first style sheet as it is a work in progress and really like some of the things I did there. I am also keeping all the original images I collected in the folder. If I end up not using them later, I will remove the excess to keep the repository clean.

I am also leaving all my notes and not reorganizing them. I will start by adding little notes sporadically and distilling them into more understandable sentences once I understand all the concepts. I am not sure I have yet, so I am going to leave them in the crazy fashion that follows my thought patterns for now.

# Conclusion

* Creating a functioning style sheets in CSS depends on proper html organization and following parent child rules

* While I had in my head for some reason I needed to limit my use of classes and id in my code, I believe this is a situation where I really failed by not assigning these things from the beginning. 

* I do need to work on methods of project organization - A LOT. 

* Even when I was doing it completely wrong, I was learning. I am getting better at trying to understand how to form my questions so that google and others can understand what I need help with. I have started my own vocabulary list to help me review terms as well.
